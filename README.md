![Comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278b8bc8-94ec-4cf6-be8a-8fd878681c9c)Ran a comparison between C++ and CUDA. 
The difference is negligible, rather CUDA loses when Arrayis small. The story changes when we bump up the array size. As you can see, CPP does the same compile in ~0.9s while CUDA takes ~0.078!
